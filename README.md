Ivez has since remove his account in Pling and also remove most of the Dolby apk in Github. Despite claiming innocense all proof leads to his channel and also group in Telegram which are publicly available for telegram users to join. He is also active in audio community group chat eg JamesDSP and Viper4android group chat which he and his colleagues spread their politics and abusive agenda. We are not intimidated by these people who advocate and abuse Intellectual Property Rights.

There are still files hosted in Telegram which proved his copyright abuses. Notificaation is sent to dmca@telegram.org for misuse of dolby files which Ivez or his colleagues has uploaded to his Telegram group and Channels.

Association with known Abusers :
Ivez is also associated known users that often indulged in Copyright abusers. These individual has no respect on Intellectual Property and rather then look inwards they would blame others for the abuse they themselves have commited. All proof cant  be denied. Despite his claim of Innocense one by one his move is limited and None of his counter accusation stiocks since we do not involved with similar typpe of abusive activities. Rest assure nobody or any Community of users that believe in Intellectual Property will want be associated with such group of users. Ivez has embark in all out war to exclude us so we dont expose his activities. This includes using Bots to spam and banned innocent users which he practices in Telegram.
