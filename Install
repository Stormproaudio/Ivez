#We Recommend Magisk V23 (We recommend dont upgrade to v24)

#If your device already have V2.7.2.1 and a working Viper Driver..You can just directly Install Stormviper V2.5 apk. (it wont update your existing v2.7.2.1 installation) and skip Next Step

#Install Storm Revolution V3 Zip = https://github.com/Stormproaudio/revolution/blob/main/Storm-Revolution-V3-MagiskModule.zip ( We recommend fresh install roight after Magisk V23 is insalled ) to be install first without any other audio Modules in magisk. Flash Storm V3 Zip Reboot

#nstall Stormviper v2.5. Start Storviper v2.5 recheck driver status ensure all are ok. Test with Audio mp3, wa or various app (youtube etc)

#Your converted IRS from V2.7.2.1 wont work wwith this Mod!. This Mod retains old original IRS format. Never copy old conoverted preset to Stormviper preset folder!

#Ensure StormViper is working, Next Disable the older Apk (that was installed by Storm Revolution or you old v2.7.2.1 or etc apk) and only leave Stormviper only enabled. REBOOT !

#Recheck Viper after Reboot. Its best only leave stormviper on system the rest just disabled ! dont uninstalled old APk or you risk uninstalled the driver!
